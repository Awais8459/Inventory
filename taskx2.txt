Keeping In Mind the previous task of products inventory with bulk upload:
extend the task by:
Start from scratch but help can be taken from previous material.
adding gallery feature to the project where by folders can be created and images ( in future videos ) can be uploaded.
Gallery:
1. Bulk upload files to a root folder/directory or nested directory.All this data have to be in db.
2. Update files by providing move functionality(from folder to folder).
3. For delete functionality, api can accept multiple ids for file or folders or both. deleting a folder shall delete all folders and files inside that folder.
4. after bulk uploading the products data,


5. each product can be individually updated by attaching image urls to that specific product. incase the images were not added during bulk addition of product data
also for a specific product, the user can upload an array of images.


GET api/products
POST api/products
GET api/prdoucts/:id
DELETE api/products/:id   ---> (that this should be able to delete multpile products)
PATCH api/products/:id    can be used to update a product ( be it additional images for products or changing price name etc)

GET api/gallery
POST api/gallery         (can create one folder at a time or bulk upload of images to a folder)
GET api/gallery:id      (if folder, shall bring all the inside content, otherwise image record details)
GET api/folder-tree     (shall bring all the folders only, keeping the tree structure uniform with database, as child and parent)
DELETE api/gallery/:id  (shall be able to accept an array of ids, be it folder or files, and delete them. inside content of folders must also get deleted)
PACTH api/gallery/:id   (can update the image name, its location(like in which folder), can move the image or folder into or out of other folders, to a specific folder)

Make proper postman documentation for above task.
